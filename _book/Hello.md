Let's write your very first program in Hexa!

If you're already familiar with programming,
take a look at [programming language comparison list](https://hexalang.github.io/book/Comparison.html).

## Quickstart

Download [Hexa compiler](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa#stable) and [support for your code editor](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa#tools--ide). 
Create new file `hello.hexa` and place anywhere you wish.

Add some pretty lines into:

```js
"TODO: Absolutely the best code sample here"
```

> Note: Hexa uses tabs for indentation
>> This is *not* enforced :relaxed:

Your file may be evaluated directly without compilation:

```sh
hexa hello.hexa
```

Expected output:

```sh

```

## Long story
