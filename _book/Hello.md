Let's write your very first program in Hexa!

If you're already familiar with programming,
take a look at a [programming language comparison list](https://hexalang.github.io/book/Comparison.html).

## Quickstart

Download [Hexa compiler](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa#stable) and [syntax highlighting for your code editor](https://github.com/hexalang/hexa#tools--ide). 
Create new file `hello.hexa` and place anywhere you wish.

Drag it into code editor then add some pretty lines into:

```js
// My first program in Hexa!

/// Show greetings
function helloMessage() {
    console.log("Hello, Hexa!")
}

helloMessage()
```

> Note: Hexa uses tabs for indentation
>> This is *not* enforced :relaxed:

Your file may be evaluated directly without compilation:

```sh
hexa hello.hexa
# This is called "console command"
# if you're familiar with terminal
```

Same within code editor:

- Sublime Text â€” ...

Expected output:

```
Hello, Hexa!
```

### Long story

Let's investigate our program step-by-step:



Those gray notes are called *comments* and they don't affect program flow.
Feel free to note anything you find useful for yourself and other programmers.
You may comment out any code to disable it, so it won't be compiled:


Or multiple lines altogether:


This is a good practice to document your code
