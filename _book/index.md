## ![Hexa](https://hexalang.github.io/favicon/android-icon-192x192.png)

Hexa is a high level, strictly typed programming language. It compiles to JavaScript, native executables and other languages. Easy to use and completely crossplatfrom.

This "book" is intended to serve as a guide to help you learn the Hexa programming language. It will give you the knowledge you need to get started.

It assumes that you have some familiarity with the basics of programming, such as using a code editor and terminal, and concepts such as variables, looping, recursion, types and data structures. Background in imperative programming with some knowledge of functional programming ideas will be very helpful. Sometimes it makes a comparison to some other programming language (like JavaScript) to provide some additional information.
