I am often asked: what is Hexa and how it differs than language-xyz?

Some examples:
> how hexa will be better than haxe? What to purpose of this Lang?

Some links from deep multi-year history of the project:
- 2014 LuaXe Lua target for Haxe <https://github.com/bradparks/LuaXe> (fork of <https://github.com/PeyTy/LuaXe>) was my research in dynamic languages optimization
- 2014 Attempt on LLVM Haxe backend <https://github.com/bradparks/Native> (fork of <https://github.com/PeyTy/Native>)
- 2015 Announcing Alternative Haxe <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/haxelang/zGLnwJRaThU/kCwQ46HmSW8J>
- 2016 OpenHaxe opportunity <https://twitter.com/PeyTyPeyTy/status/737680277569425408>
- 2017 Hexa <https://github.com/hexalang/hexa> my final decision to roll out my own programming language

Results? Well...

So I want to announce a short blog posts series about design decisions, experiments and so on.
They are always available via `blog` <https://github.com/hexalang/hexa/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=label%3Ablog%20> label in this repository. Follow <https://twitter.com/hexalang> for updates.
